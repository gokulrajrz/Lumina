# Documentation Policy

**CRITICAL RULE**: Do not create documentation files (markdown files, summaries, reports, guides, etc.) unless explicitly requested by the user.

This includes:
- Summary documents
- Verification reports
- Implementation guides
- Status reports
- Test result documents
- Any other markdown documentation

Focus on code and actionable changes only. Keep responses concise without creating unnecessary documentation artifacts.
